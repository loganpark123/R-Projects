## GO WHERE THE LOCALS GO
Memphians know great BBQ. And since it opened in 2002, Central BBQ has been ranked as the number one spot for BBQ in Memphis. The secrets to Central’s success?

## Fall-off-the-Bone Meat
You might have heard us say, “Smoke is Our Sauce.” That’s because we live in the hardwood capital of the world and use hickory and pecan woods, along with our intricate dry rub and a whole lot of patience, to craft the most tender, delicious piece of meat you’ve ever eaten— with or without the sauce.

## Southern Hospitality
We firmly believe even the best food falls flat without great hospitality. We’ll serve anyone hungry for BBQ and we’ll do it with the same generosity we would our best friends.

## Good Times
We take our BBQ seriously— but that’s where the serious stops around here. At Central BBQ, we encourage our guests to unwind, get messy, and most importantly, savor their time with us.
